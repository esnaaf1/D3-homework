# HEALTH-AND-POVERTY

Poverty has long been recognized as a contributor to death and disease, but several recent trends have generated an increased focus on the link between income and health. 

In this project, using Javascript D3, I demonstrate the correlation between health risks such as smoking, obesity and lack of access to health care versus poverty by age and income across the united states. 

The interactive bubble chart, allows the user to choose from the poverty factors on the x-axis and the health risks on the y-axis to visualize the data by each state.

-----------------
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml, but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
